# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be nice. Be helpful. Be respectful.

## Guidelines

- **Be welcoming** — Help newcomers get started and feel included
- **Be constructive** — Give feedback that helps improve, not tear down
- **Be respectful** — Disagree on ideas, not people
- **Be patient** — Everyone was new once

## Zero Tolerance

Harassment, personal attacks, trolling, and deliberately disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Violators will be warned once and removed on repeat offenses.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, open a GitHub issue or contact the maintainers directly.
