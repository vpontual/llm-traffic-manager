# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be nice. Be helpful. Be respectful.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces including issues, pull requests, discussions, and any community channels associated with this project.

## Guidelines

- **Be welcoming** — Help newcomers get started and feel included
- **Be constructive** — Give feedback that helps improve, not tear down
- **Be respectful** — Disagree on ideas, not people
- **Be patient** — Everyone was new once

## Enforcement

Harassment, personal attacks, trolling, and deliberately disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

- Minor issues will receive a warning with an explanation
- Repeated or severe violations will result in a temporary or permanent ban at the maintainers' discretion

Severity is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Egregious behavior (threats, targeted harassment) may result in an immediate ban without warning.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately using [GitHub's private reporting feature](https://github.com/vpontual/ollamaproxy/security/advisories/new). This ensures your report stays confidential.

You can also reach maintainers via the contact links on their GitHub profiles.

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with discretion.
