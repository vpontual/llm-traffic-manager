# Contributing to Ollama Fleet Manager

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy and configure environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Ollama server addresses
   ```
4. Start the database:
   ```bash
   docker compose up db -d
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
6. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Working on the Proxy

If your changes involve request routing, load balancing, or the proxy server, you'll also need the proxy running:

```bash
# Build and start the proxy (separate terminal)
npm run build:proxy
npm run proxy
```

The dashboard runs on port 3000 and the proxy on port 11434. For UI-only changes, you only need `npm run dev`.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all checks (lint + typecheck + unit tests)
npm run check

# Individual commands
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Pre-commit hooks run `npm run check` automatically. They're installed when you run `npm install`.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure `npm run check` passes
4. Commit with a clear, descriptive message
5. Open a pull request against `main`
